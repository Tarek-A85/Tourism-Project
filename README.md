# About this project
Exploreo application is a system for organizing and booking tourist trips to most countries of the world, in addition to the possibility of making a hotel reservation for the place of residence, as well as the possibility of booking a flight ticket with securing  payment services to facilitate payment of the costs of reservations.

The application is interested in providing a group of diverse trips that suit the largest number of traveling users and explorers, each according to his interest, including the diversity of destinations according to the desire of travelers to spend their vacation (sea, forests, food, tourist attractions .....).

The application provides a flight ticket reservation system where the user can book flight tickets according to his desire (one way - round trip), and also a hotel reservation system that includes the hotel class, length of stay, number of rooms and people, so he can travel and take his trip as he wishes.

The application provides a search service that allows the user to search for the country he wants to visit and find out information about it by displaying the details and cities in that country and finding out details about it or searching directly for the city, or searching for hotels and airlines to find out more information and services about it.
The application is characterized by the presence of ready-made trips organized in advance by the Admin, where they can be booked directly and the user can track his trip regarding the place of residence and its duration.
The user can modify and cancel reservations before a certain period of time from the start of the reservation and an email is sent to confirm that the process was completed correctly.
The user can also add a rating and comment on all the services especially the trips he has taken, which enables the Admin to improve the trip, benefiting from the users' rating, and the highest-rated trips will be suggested to users.
In addition to ensuring the possibility of saving and storing the reservations he has made for future return.
It provides the ability to modify the personal profile and save the trips and areas that the user is interested in in lists in his favorites.







## Note
Of course we weren't able to get real API's from the companies so we simulate this idea by scheduling commands and by randomizing some responses when it comes to booking hotels.

The payment in the app is done using a wallet that the user charge by giving cash to the admin in real life then the admin charge the wallet with that cash.
